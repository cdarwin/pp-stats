## Credit

This tool was originally developed by Adam Denning ([adenning](https://github.com/adenning/pp-stats)).

When I found it, the repo only had a single commit almost one year old. It provided a very good starting point, so I have forked it and added some bits for my own needs. I have kept Adam's initial commit for posterity and I have added an [MIT License](LICENSE.txt) for good measure.
